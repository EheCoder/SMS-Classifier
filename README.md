# SMS Spam Classifier

This project is a text classification model built using Python and Streamlit. It classifies SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled SMS messages, and it uses TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier for classification.

## How to Use

To use the SMS Spam Classifier, simply enter an SMS message into the text input field and click the "Classify" button. The app will classify the message as either spam or ham and display the result.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
